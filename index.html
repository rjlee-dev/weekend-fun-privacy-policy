    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 8, 2025</p>

    <p>Weekend Fun ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Weekend Fun mobile application ("the App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information from users. 
    The App may store your preferences (such as budget, group size, age range, and location) locally on your device 
    to provide tailored activity suggestions. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share it.</p>

    <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
    <p>If you enable location services, the App uses your approximate location to suggest nearby activities. 
    Your location data is processed only on your device and is not sent to us or stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for displaying ads.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> – to generate activity suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third-party services may collect anonymized usage data as outlined in their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>If you choose to subscribe or make in-app purchases, transactions are handled securely through Apple’s App Store. 
    We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All personal preferences and data are stored locally on your device. We do not operate any external databases 
    for user information.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can disable location services at any time through your device settings. You can also delete the App to remove 
    all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated 
    "Last updated" date.</p>
